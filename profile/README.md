## [NOAA 'Omics Data Technical Portal](https://noaa-omics-technical-portal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  
This portal is a central repository for NOAA 'Omics resources including protocols, bioinformatics software, training resources, and aggregated relevant repositories from NOAA Line Offices.

## [NOAA 'Omics Data Management Guide](https://noaa-omics-dmg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
This data management guide facilitates public access to data produced by every NOAA omics project and ensuring that they are usable by future researchers. The focus of this guide is to help omics users decide which data goes to which repositories (NCEI, NCBI, etc.), and how to deposit their data so that it will be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), including following community standards for raw data, processed data, and contextual metadata and environmental data.

## [NOAA 'Omics Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-Omics/discussions)  
This discussion forum is a place 'Omics practitioners can leave questions for the NOAA 'Omics community to respond to. Discussion topics include field, lab, bioinformatics, data management, announcements, and new ideas.
